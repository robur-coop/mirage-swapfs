Unlike swap in other operating systems memory has to be moved explicitly to unnamed files. The filesystem is backed by a block device. New data can only be appended to the unnamed file, but data can be read at any offset of the file.</p></header><nav class="odoc-toc"><ul><li><a href="#see-">See <code>Swapfs</code></a><ul><li><a href="#blocking-factor">Blocking factor</a></li></ul></li></ul></nav><div class="odoc-content"><h2 id="see-"><a href="#see-" class="anchor"></a>See <a href="Swapfs/index.html"><code>Swapfs</code></a></h2><p>The function <a href="Swapfs/Make/index.html#val-empty"><code>Swapfs.Make.empty</code></a> returns a handle to a fresh, empty unnamed file. Then <a href="Swapfs/Make/index.html#val-append"><code>Swapfs.Make.append</code></a> is used to append new data to the file. Data can then be read back in chunks with <a href="Swapfs/Make/index.html#val-get_partial"><code>Swapfs.Make.get_partial</code></a> at arbitrary offsets. Once the user is done with the unnamed file they can call <a href="Swapfs/Make/index.html#val-free"><code>Swapfs.Make.free</code></a> on the handle to free up blocks for use in other handles. Handles are hooked up with the garbage collector such that blocks are automatically freed once the handle is garbage collected.</p><h3 id="blocking-factor"><a href="#blocking-factor" class="anchor"></a>Blocking factor</h3><p>If allocations were naïvely tracked per-sector the memory usage of the swap filesystem itself would easily approach the storage capacity of the block device! So in order to reduce memory usage by the allocations on the block device are done in <code>block_factor</code> sectors at a time. The default <code>blocking_factor</code> in <a href="Swapfs/Make/index.html#val-connect"><code>Swapfs.Make.connect</code></a> is <code>2048</code>. For a block device with 512 byte sectors this means allocations are tracked in 1 MiB chunks. Let's assume the memory usage for bookkeeping is 32 bytes - I don't know the exact number, but likely it's in that order. With a <code>blocking_factor</code> of 1 we would then use 32 bytes to track a 512 byte block - a 6.25% overhead. With a <code>blocking_factor</code> of 2048 we would use 32 bytes to track instead a 1 MiB block - the overhead is then roughly 0.003%.</p><p>In other words, the higher the blocking factor the less overhead there is in the bookkeeping. On the other hand, a higher blocking factor means less efficient usage of the block device. In the current implementation, with a fixed blocking factor the bookkeeping overhead is linear in the number of sectors in the block device.</p></div></body></html>
